// Welcome. Welcome all to my very second Kata. As you know, the first one was a huge success. This time, however, things are going to be a little bit different. Is it going to be as cool as the last one? Let's find out! Tell your friends! ï˜‹

// Given an integer b greater than 0, create and return a b X b matrix with the following pattern:
//
//   [x,1]
// matrixSquareUp(2) => [2,1]
//
//   [x,x,1]
//   [x,2,1]
// matrixSquareUp(3) => [3,2,1]
//
//   [x,x,x,1]
//   [x,x,2,1]
//   [x,3,2,1]
// matrixSquareUp(4) => [4,3,2,1]

const matrixSquareUp = n => {
  return Array.from({length: n}, (a, i) => Array.from({length: n}, (b, j) => j <= i ? (j + 1).toString() : 'x').reverse());
}
